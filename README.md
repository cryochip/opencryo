# opencryo
First cryochip core to be taped out on skywater openPDK shuttle.

## Brief Description

Opencryo is the first version of the cryochip project that is expected to be taped out using skywater 130 nm openPDK shuttle provided by the [FOSSi/Google initiative](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk).

In this first version our main goal is to characterize the active and passive devices in order to provide a good model to design them at ultra low temperatures for quantum computer applications. To learn more about, see [references page](Criar references page).

## Opencryo blocks

In this first tape out will be submitted many transistors, passives and core blocks in order to perform a first characterization. Main blocks are described below:

### Characterization circuits

...

### Ring oscillator
...

### VCO (Control core)

...

### LNA (Read core)

...

### Caravel SoC Harness

One of the pre-requisites to use open MPW is to use an user area inside a SoC named Caravel. Due to that requirement, we did a separated repository for that: XXX
