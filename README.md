# opencryo
First cryochip core to be taped out on skywater openPDK shuttle.

## Brief Description

Opencryo is the first version of the cryochip project that is expected to be taped out using skywater 130 nm openPDK shuttle provided by the [FOSSi/Google initiative](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk).

In this first version our main goal is to characterize the active and passive devices in order to provide a good model for them at ultra low temperatures to quantum computer applications. To learn more about see [references page](Criar references page).
